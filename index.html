		<h1>Hello I'm Appoline </h1>
	<img src="images/profile-picture.png" class="img-circle" width="200px" alt="Appoline Fouris">
	<p> 
		I am currently in my first year at the IESEG School of Management in Lille, Northern France. I'm a rather creative person, I like everything related to art and I also love to travel all over the world.

	<h2>My hobbies</h2>
	<p>
		I am passionate about art and more specifically about fashion and architecture. Indeed, I like to read fashion magazines such as Vogue, or watch the shows of the different fashion weeks in New York, Milan, London and Paris. Moreover, I like to travel a lot and especially far away and in countries and cities with warm climates like Mauritius, Dubai, Abu Dhabi...

	<h2>My projects for the future</h2>
	<p>
		For the future, I hope to work in an international environement and abroad in an other continent such as in Asia or America. As for the sector of activity, the ideal would be a company related to my passions, i.e. fashion or architecture, such as Duir, Hermès, Barnes, Miralbo... Being an ambitious and determined person, I would like to work in a position with important and high responsibilities.

	<h2>How I spend my free time</h2>
	<p>
		At IESEG, between the projects, the 3h classes and the qcm and contrary to what other students who are not in business might think, the free time is not huge either. But when I have some, I like to spend it with my friends in a bar drinking a beer and discussing about anything and everything or going to the movies or seeing football games. I prefer to go out than to stay in my apartment alone. And in the evening, Lille is transformed and there is no lack of student parties, dance bars and nightclubs!
